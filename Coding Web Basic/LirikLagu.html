            When I look into your eyes
            I can see a love restrained 
            But darlin' when I hold you
            Don't you know I feel the same?

            Nothin' lasts forever
            And we both know hearts can change
            And it's hard to hold a candle
            In the cold November rain

            We've been through this such a long long time
            Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeah
            Love is always coming, love is always going
            No one's really sure who's lettin' go today
            Walking away

            If we could take the time to lay it on the line
            I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine
            All mine
            So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
            Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain
            
            Do you need some time on your own?
            Do you need some time all alone?
            Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
            Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
            
            I know it's hard to keep an open heart
            When even friends seem out to harm you
            But if you could heal a broken heart
            Wouldn't time be out to charm you?
            Oh, oh, oh

            Sometimes I need some time on my own
            Sometimes I need some time all alone
            Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
            Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
            
            And when your fears subside
            And shadows still remain, oh yeah
            I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
            So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way
            'Cause nothin' lasts forever, even cold November rain
        
            Don't ya think that you need somebody?
            Don't ya think that you need someone?
